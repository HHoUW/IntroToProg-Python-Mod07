Exception Handling and Pickling
===============================



Introduction
------------
In this report, I will give an overview of Exception Handling and Pickling in Python.  I will go over a Python script I created to demonstrate these two concepts.  The program presents the user with two separate demos, one for each concept that the user can choose to view.



Exception Handling
------------------

In Python, errors that occur during code execution are called exceptions.  When exceptions occur, Python stops the program and displays an error message detailing the exception (Figure 1).  There are a of number exception types.  A few common ones are: 

+ •	TypeError - occurs when an operation is applied to objects of inappropriate types.
+ •	ValueError - occurs when an operation receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value.
+ •	ZeroDivisionError – occurs when the second argument of a division operation is zero.
